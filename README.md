# webpack-configs

Testing and playing around with some of webpack's interesting and complex features to create robust
configurations for development and production environments. The end goal is for this to be a platform 
that optimizes build times, improves performance, manages dependencies, and provides flexible tooling that 
can be easily integrated into any JavaScript front-end project.
